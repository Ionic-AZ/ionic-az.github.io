To make life easy, I found a pretty sweet library called Socket.io, which will do a lot of the tough broadcasting work.<br /><br />We’re going to see how to create a very simple chat application, that with a little imagination, can become something incredible." tags="couchbase, node, socket.io" author="Nic Raboy" twitter="nraboy" %}
